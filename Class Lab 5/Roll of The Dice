/**
     * In a certain game, a player is awarded a number of points based on the
     * roll of three fair, six-sided dice according to the following rules:
     *
     * 1.  If the dice all have the same value, the player is awarded the sum of the dice.
     * 2.  If the sum of the dice is odd, the player is awarded 2 points.
     * 3.  If the sum of the dice is even, the player is awarded half the sum of
     *     dice.
     *
     * For example, if the player rolls
     *
     * 4 and 4 and 4, the player is awarded 12 points.
     * 2 and 5 and 3, the player is awarded 5 points.
     * 4 and 6 and 1, the player is awarded 2 points.
     *
     * This function takes as input the value of each die and returns the number
