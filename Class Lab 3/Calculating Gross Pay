     * This method calculates a worker's gross pay according to their employee
     * type.  "Exempt" employees are paid straight time for all hours worked no
     * matter the number of hours.  "Hourly" employees are paid straight time
     * for all hours worked up to and including 40 hours.  For hours worked over
     * the first 40 hours, hourly employees are paid time and a half.  "Plus"
     * employees are paid straight time for all hours worked up to and including 
     * 40 hours, time and a half for up to five hours worked over the first 40
     * hours, and double time for hours worked over the first 45 hours.
     * 
     * E.g., An Exempt employee works 47 hours at a rate of $10.50 and is paid $493.50.
     *       An Hourly employee works 47 hours at a rate of $10.50 and is paid 
     *          (40 * 10.5) + (7 * 1.5 * 10.5) = $530.25.
     *       An Plus employee works 47 hours at a rate of $10.50 and is paid
     *          (40 * 10.5) + (5 * 1.5 * 10.5) + (2 * 2 * 10.5) = $540.75.
     *          
     * @param hoursWorked The number of hours the employee worked.
     * @param rate The hourly rate at which the employee is paid.
     * @param empType The employee's classification.  Valid types are Exempt, Hourly, and Plus.
     * @return The employee's gross pay.
